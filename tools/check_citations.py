"""Citation-attribution gate.

A requirement that reports what another requirement SAYS is making a checkable
claim about a specific span of text. On 2026-09-03 several of those claims were
false, in both directions: `WIR-20` and `WIR-35` attributed this set's
wire-contract precedence rule to `WIR-1`, which carries the JSON, money and
timestamp conventions and says nothing of the kind; `DOM-30` reported that
`WIR-30` forbids what `WIR-30` in fact mandates. Two full review passes at
`high` effort read past all of them. See `ddd3df0` and `254fc24`.

The other gates cannot see this class. `check_ids.py` is satisfied -- the
citation resolves to a real identifier. `check_obligations.py` is satisfied --
no duty is being assigned. The sentence reads fluently. Only the relationship
between the claim and the cited text is broken.

TWO RULES, deliberately narrow.

  QUOTED   A quoted phrase attributed to `X` must appear in X's own body.
           Hard failure: the quote either occurs there or it does not, so a
           finding is provable and needs no judgement.

  UNQUOTED "`X` says/states/reads ..." with no quote at all is unverifiable by
           construction. Ratcheted against `citation-baseline.json` rather than
           failed outright, because such sentences already exist and a gate that
           fails a clean tree is a gate someone deletes. New ones are refused;
           the standing ones come down as their requirements are next edited.
           The count lives in that file and nowhere else -- a number written
           into prose is wrong the first time either end moves, which this set
           has now learned in `ADR-0003`, `ADR-0011` and `F16`.

Summary verbs are deliberately OUT OF SCOPE. "`OPS-12` forbids automatic retry"
is a correct, useful paraphrase, and most attributions in the set are of that
shape. Demanding a quote there would fire on legitimate prose, which is how a
checklist item ends up unsatisfiable by every conforming implementation
(`CNF-224`).

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, stated plainly because a gate's limits are part of its
contract: a wrong SUMMARY. "`WIR-30` forbids the server resolving eligibility
that way" reverses `WIR-30`'s meaning, uses a summary verb, and carries no
quote -- no lexical signal separates it from a correct summary. That one was the
worst defect of 2026-09-03 and it stays a review problem.

A third rule, added with the rendering gate (`ADR-0025`, 2026-09-15):

  NAMES    A backticked `Provisiond.*` name is a citation of a Lean declaration
           and must resolve against the index `lake exe gate` writes: a tagged
           declaration, a namespace or module holding one, or the `Explore`
           namespace `Gate.lean` exempts. A renamed declaration leaves a
           dangling name, and this is the gate that sees it. Hard failure. Not
           caught: a declaration renamed with a new one tagged under the old
           name, which resolves. The
           index is written by `tools/check_formal.sh`, which `check-all.sh`
           runs first; a missing index is a red gate, not a skipped rule.

Exit 0 = clean, 1 = an unverifiable quote, an unresolved name or a rise above
the baseline, 2 = the index is missing.
