"""Orphaned-obligation gate.

A requirement that assigns a duty to ANOTHER requirement's subject -- "`LDG-62`
MUST conditional-write that row guarded on `destroy_committed IS NULL`" -- states
that duty in the wrong document. Nobody implementing `LDG-62` from
`12-billing-and-ledger.md` ever reads `OPS-42`, so the duty is never built, and
the requirement that depends on it is quietly false.

That is not a hypothetical. It shipped on 2026-08-31 and survived until
2026-09-02. `OPS-42` is the fence protecting a paying customer's machine from an
in-flight cancellation; it stated `LDG-62`'s half of the contention, and `LDG-62`
did not contain the string `destroy_committed` at all. The fence did not fence.
Two full-set cross-model reviews read past it. A subagent editing `LDG-62` for an
unrelated reason found it by accident.

The other gates cannot see this class. `check_ids.py` is satisfied -- the
citation resolves. `check_coverage.py` is satisfied -- both requirements have
conformance items. The text reads correctly in both places. Only the RELATIONSHIP
is broken, and only a check that follows it can tell.

THE RULE: where requirement A says "`B` MUST <clause>" and the clause names
concrete machinery in backticks -- a column, a field, a state -- B's own body
must mention at least one of those names. B is free to phrase its duty however it
likes; it is not free to be silent about it.

Deliberately conservative. It fires only when the target mentions NONE of the
clause's identifiers, because a partial match is usually a requirement that
discharges its duty in its own vocabulary. Against the whole set at the commit
where the fence bug existed, this reports exactly one finding: the fence bug.

Exit 0 = clean, 1 = at least one orphaned obligation.
