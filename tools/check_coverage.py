"""Conformance-coverage gate.

The conformance checklist IS this project's test suite -- there is no code. So
the question "which requirements does nothing ever demonstrate?" is the same
question as "what is untested?", and it is not answerable by reading: a
requirement with no conformance item contradicts nothing, so every review pass
walks straight past it.

This gate measures it. A requirement is COVERED when at least one CNF item
cites it. Coverage may not fall below the recorded baseline.

The baseline exists because `11-open-findings.md` records this failure twice
already -- F22 and F23, both cases of a session adding requirements faster than
conformance items, noticed only when somebody counted:

    "this session created open findings faster than a careless reader would
     notice, because a hundred new requirements arrived with no conformance
     items and no wire format. A specification that grows faster than its
     checklist is getting less testable, not more finished."

Two namespaces are excluded from the ratchet and reported separately:

  SEC -- 07-security-requirements.md's own scope note makes it cite rules owned
         elsewhere rather than restate them, so an uncited SEC requirement is
         usually the convention working.
  WIR -- CNF-176 blanket-covers every JSON fixture in one item, so per-id
         citation understates wire coverage.

Both are still printed, because "usually" is not "always".

Exit status 0 = at or above baseline, 1 = regression.
